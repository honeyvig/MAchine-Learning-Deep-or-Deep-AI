# MAchine-Learning-Deep-or-Deep-AI
I Need a trainer and predictor using AI, machine learning, or deep learning. There is a historical data file and a daily file to run against the historical data for prediction.

The historical file is made up of daily files. Each day, a person tries to predict a winning number from 1-8 (chosen at random). There is one absolute winning number and one absolute losing number.

The person makes 32 attempts each day and picks all 8 numbers from the 1st number pick through the 8th number pick.

The daily data has 256 nodes or cells of numbers. 32 rounds x 8 picks.

The historical data simply shows the location of the win and lose for each of the 32 rounds in cells 1-8

The goal is to pick the winning number on the 1st pick but is not always the case.

As an example:

Round 9 on the 6th Pick has one of the highest success rates for picking the winning number.

Round 14 on the 1st Pick has one of the highest success rates for picking the losing number.

Goals.

1. Identify the winning and losing percentage of each of the 256 cells.

2. Determine if its % is constant and consistent. For example the 5th pick column has the highest correct pick rate for the winning number. This varies a lot however among the 32 rounds.

3. Once the winning/losing % is defined by each of the individual 256 cells, determine if each cell is out of balance.

For example, split the data in half and compare the oldest half to the newest half of days. If days 1-30 Round 12 and the 5th pick (cell 93) has a win % of 65% in the 1st half and days 31-60 have a win % of 10% win % in the 2nd half, this would be a polarity/pendulum cell. Simply find the average (37.5% win% overall) and when the avg % is out of balance, simply predict the opposite, (win becomes neutral, and neutral becomes win) (lose becomes neutral, and neutral becomes lose).

Do this for all 256 cells. We need the trainer to come up with a minimum % variance and/or possibly weights.

Initially, I need to be able to run the trainer/predictor on my Windows PC using the CPU. I have an i-9 chip with 256 gigs of ddr5 ram. Please create a Windows EXE. I am not coder.

Also, I have been having some success with the xgboost trainer but am open to any and all solutions.

I will provide you with the historical data file and 3 daily files. You will know the results of the 3 daily files for testing purposes.

=======================
 I'll provide an overview of how we can develop a trainer and predictor using AI or machine learning techniques. The solution involves data preparation, feature engineering, training a model, and generating predictions.

Here’s how this can be implemented:
Workflow

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load the historical and daily data files.
        Organize the data into rows representing each cell (256 cells per day) with the associated winning and losing numbers.
        Create features such as cell index, round, pick number, historical win/loss rates, and day-to-day changes.

    Feature Engineering:
        Calculate the winning and losing percentage for each of the 256 cells over time.
        Compare historical halves (older vs. newer days) to find polarities.
        Create new features to represent this variance.

    Training the Model:
        Use XGBoost or another machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for classification or regression.
        Train the model to predict the probability of a cell being a winning or losing pick.

    Prediction:
        For a new daily file, the model evaluates each of the 256 cells and predicts:
            Winning probability.
            Losing probability.
        Highlight cells with the highest predicted win or loss rates.

    Evaluation:
        Use the 3 provided daily files to validate the model's accuracy and performance.

    EXE Creation:
        Use PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to package the Python code into a Windows executable.

Python Code

Here’s a complete example:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from joblib import dump, load

# Step 1: Load Data
def load_data(historical_file, daily_files):
    historical_data = pd.read_csv(historical_file)
    daily_data = [pd.read_csv(file) for file in daily_files]
    return historical_data, daily_data

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Add features like cell index, round, pick number, etc.
    data['CellIndex'] = (data['Round'] - 1) * 8 + data['Pick']
    data['WinRate'] = data.groupby('CellIndex')['Win'].transform('mean')
    data['LoseRate'] = data.groupby('CellIndex')['Lose'].transform('mean')

    # Calculate historical halves and polarity
    midpoint = len(data) // 2
    first_half = data.iloc[:midpoint]
    second_half = data.iloc[midpoint:]
    
    data['Polarity'] = abs(first_half['WinRate'].mean() - second_half['WinRate'].mean())
    return data

# Step 3: Train Model
def train_model(historical_data):
    X = historical_data[['CellIndex', 'WinRate', 'LoseRate', 'Polarity']]
    y = historical_data['Win']  # Target variable
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model = xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Validate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    print("Validation Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred))

    # Save the model
    dump(model, 'trained_model.joblib')
    return model

# Step 4: Predict on Daily Data
def predict_daily(model, daily_data):
    predictions = []
    for daily_file in daily_data:
        daily_file['Prediction'] = model.predict(daily_file[['CellIndex', 'WinRate', 'LoseRate', 'Polarity']])
        predictions.append(daily_file)
    return predictions

# Main Function
def main():
    # Paths to files
    historical_file = 'historical_data.csv'
    daily_files = ['daily_file1.csv', 'daily_file2.csv', 'daily_file3.csv']

    # Load and preprocess data
    historical_data, daily_data = load_data(historical_file, daily_files)
    historical_data = preprocess_data(historical_data)

    # Train model
    model = train_model(historical_data)

    # Predict on daily files
    predictions = predict_daily(model, daily_data)

    # Save predictions
    for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
        pred.to_csv(f'daily_predictions_{i + 1}.csv', index=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Explanation of the Code

    Data Loading:
        The historical data is used to train the model.
        The daily data files are used for testing and validation.

    Feature Engineering:
        Each cell is assigned a unique CellIndex.
        Winning and losing percentages are calculated per cell.
        Polarity is determined by comparing historical halves.

    Model Training:
        The model is trained to classify cells as likely winning (1) or not (0).
        XGBoost is chosen for its ability to handle tabular data efficiently.

    Prediction:
        The trained model evaluates daily files to predict winning and losing probabilities.

    Output:
        Predictions are saved to CSV files for review.
